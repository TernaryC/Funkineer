# Funkineer
A mod conversion tool for Friday Night Funkin'

Convert mods created for the standard FNF engine into the format and directories needed to use them with Kade Engine.
Supports all versions of the Kade Engine.

Other mod engines to be added once I've heard about them.

If you use FileDaddy to manage your FNF mods then this is pretty useless, but I don't, so I decided to make it. And it does have some potential use for mod
creators, too, if you want to have multiple engine-formatted versions of your mod and don't want to have to make the different versions yourself.
