# Funkineer
A mod conversion tool for Friday Night Funkin'

Link to GameBanana page: https://gamebanana.com/tools/7233

This tool converts mods formatted for use with specific FNF engines to formats compatible with other engines.

I.E. You can use this to reformat a mod made for standard FNF to the folder layout used in Kade Engine 1.5+.

This could be helpful for mod makers as well as users, as you only have to set up your mod once, for one engine, and then you can simply convert it to the other engines you want to release versions for.

**DISCLAIMER:** This should go without saying, but, this tool will not convert executable files. It just reorganizes the files in the /assets folder to match the layout expected by different engines.

Currently supported engines are Funkin' Standard, Kade Engine (1.0-1.4), and Kade Engine (1.5+).

If your preferred FNF engine uses a different file layout to these, please let me know and I will look into adding support for it in future versions.

If you use FileDaddy to manage your mods, this won't be very useful to you, since it now will automatically reformat mods. I actually started development on this program before I knew that FileDaddy offered this.
